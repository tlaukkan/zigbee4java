/**
 * Remove All Groups Command value object class.
 * 
 * 
 * Cluster: Groups
 * The ZigBee specification provides the capability for group addressing. That is,
 * any endpoint on any device may be assigned to one or more groups, each labeled
 * with a 16-bit identifier (0x0001 â€“ 0xfff7), which acts for all intents and purposes
 * like a network address. Once a group is established, frames, sent using the
 * APSDE-DATA.request primitive and having a DstAddrMode of 0x01, denoting
 * group addressing, will be delivered to every endpoint assigned to the group
 * address named in the DstAddr parameter of the outgoing APSDE-DATA.request
 * primitive on every device in the network for which there are such endpoints.
 * <br>
 * Management of group membership on each device and endpoint is implemented
 * by the APS, but the over-the-air messages that allow for remote management and
 * commissioning of groups are defined here in the cluster library on the theory that,
 * while the basic group addressing facilities are integral to the operation of the
 * stack, not every device will need or want to implement this management cluster.
 * Furthermore, the placement of the management commands here allows developers
 * of proprietary profiles to avoid implementing the library cluster but still exploit
 * group addressing
 * 
 * Code is autogenerated. Modifications may be overwritten!
